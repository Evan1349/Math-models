# ðŸ§® Mathematical Modeling Projects 

This repository is a personal collection of mathematical modeling notebooks written in Python.  
It focuses on building dynamic simulations based on foundational calculus concepts, such as differential equations and numerical integration.

## âœ… Purpose

To reinforce and apply core ideas from **introductory calculus** â€” like derivatives, rates of change, and initial value problems â€” by building simulations and visualizing them with Python.

This project is part of a long-term self-training plan toward:
- Mathematical modeling proficiency
- Scientific computing practice
- Research-oriented problem solving
